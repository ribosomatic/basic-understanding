Chemical bonds are based on electromagnetic forces, the attraction between negatively and positively charged particles. Generally, _strong_ chemical bonds hold individual molecules together, and _weak_ bonds connect different molecules.

### Strong chemical bonds

These are _intramolecular_ forces. Ionic bonds are usually the strongest.

| Bond type        | Formed by       | Example |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
|Ionic             |Exchange of electrons between ions with opposite charges | NaCl |
|Polar covalent    |Unequal sharing of electrons between atoms (when one is significantly more electronegative) | H<sub>2</sub>O |
|Nonpolar covalent |Equal sharing of electrons between atoms (of the same or different elements) |O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, S-S |
|Metallic          |Sharing of free electrons among a structure of positively charged ions | Cu, Ag |

### Weak chemical bonds

These are _intermolecular_ forces. Hydrogen bonds (a type of dipole-dipole interaction) are the strongest.

| Bond type        | Formed by       | Example |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
|Hydrogen bonds    |Hydrogen in water which has a slight positive change and is attracted to negative charges | H with F, O, or N |
|Dipole-dipole interactions (van der Waals forces) |Two polarized molecules | HCl-HCl |
|London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces) |Temporary imbalances in electron distribution between nearby molecules | |
|Hydrophobic interactions|Water and hydrophobes (non-polarized molecules) | Fat and water |


## Valence electrons

Electrons in an atom are distributed in different shells around the nucleus starting from a low-energy inner shell and filling subsequent shells further away from the nucleus. The first shell (often labelled _1n_) can have up to 2 electrons, the next one (_2n_) - up to 8, the next one (_3n_) - up to 18, etc. The electrons in the outermost shell are called _valence electrons_ and are responsible for forming chemical bonds, if the shell is not filled. Atoms strive to become stable by completing their outermost shell.

For example, if an atom has 7 valence electrons (such as F) it needs just one more electron to complete its outermost shell. It will tend to act with a great force to attract and share (or steal) an electron from another atom - forming a covalent (or, more likely, an ionic) bond.

In contrast, if an atom has 1 valence electron (such as Li or Na) it will be very willing to give it away and achieve a closed shell. This will make it a positively charged ion.

## Electron configuration

The shells mentioned earlier correspond to principal quantum numbers (n), starting at 1, where the maximum number of electrons each shell can accommodate is $$ 2n^2 $$. The factor of 2 is because of electron spin - for example, in the first shell there could be two electrons - one with a spin of -1/2 and the other with a spin of +1/2.

Each shell actually consists of a number of subshells matching the number _n_. So the first shell has 1 subshell, the second - 2, the third - 3, etc.
The subshells correspond to secondary quantum numbers (l), starting at 0, where the maximum number of electrons in a subshell is $$ 2(2l+1) $$. They are labelled as _s_ (l=0), _p_ (l=1), _d_ (l=2), and _f_ (l=3) and are called orbitals.

|Shell |Orbitals     |Max electrons
|------|-------------|--------------
| n=1  |1s           | 2
| n=2  |2s,2p        | 8 (2+6)
| n=3  |3s,3p,3d     | 18 (2+6+10)
| n=4  |4s,4p,4d,4f  | 32 (2+6+10+14)

Electron configuration is the distribution of electrons in atomic orbitals.
Orbital notation is written in the format $$ 1s^22s^22p^3 $$. This example means there are 2 electrons in the 1st s orbital, 2 electrons in the 2nd s orbital, and 3 electrons in the 2nd p orbital. That's a total of 7 electrons which describes the (neutral) Nitrogen atom. It has 5 valence electrons (the electrons in the second shell).
