## Overview

Chemical bonds are based on electromagnetic forces, the attraction between negatively and positively charged particles. Generally, _strong_ chemical bonds hold individual molecules together, and _weak_ bonds connect different molecules.

### Strong chemical bonds

These are _intramolecular_ forces. Ionic bonds are usually the strongest.

| Bond type        | Formed by       | Example |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
|Ionic             |Exchange of electrons between ions with opposite charges | NaCl |
|Polar covalent    |Unequal sharing of electrons between atoms (when one is significantly more electronegative) | H<sub>2</sub>O |
|Nonpolar covalent |Equal sharing of electrons between atoms (of the same or different elements) |O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, S-S |
|Metallic          |Sharing of free electrons among a structure of positively charged ions | Cu, Ag |

### Weak chemical bonds

These are _intermolecular_ forces. Hydrogen bonds (a type of dipole-dipole interaction) are the strongest.

| Bond type        | Formed by       | Example |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
|Hydrogen bonds    |Hydrogen in water which has a slight positive change and is attracted to negative charges | H with F, O, or N |
|Dipole-dipole interactions (van der Waals forces) |Two polarized molecules | HCl-HCl |
|London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces) |Temporary imbalances in electron distribution between nearby molecules | |
|Hydrophobic interactions|Water and hydrophobes (non-polarized molecules) | Fat and water |
