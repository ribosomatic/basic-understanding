Proteins are at the core of all living organisms. Often simply associated with one of the essential nutrients in out diet (or with steak) the word _protein_ can refer to many things. It is the _hemoglobin_ in your red blood cells, the _keratin_ that makes your hair, _insulin_ regulating blood sugar, or _lactase_ digesting the lactose in milk. Or the antibody attaching to a flu virus. Because of this great variety there are more specific terms to refer to some of them so it helps to know when you are reading about hormones, enzymes, antibodies or receptors that they are all just proteins.

## Protein structure

![Protein amino acid chain][protein_amino_acid_chain]

At a basic level, proteins are very long chains of amino acids - small molecules - held together by covalent chemical bonds. As you can see from the picture above, an amino acid has an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>), a carboxyl group (-COOH) and an R-group (or side chain) specific to each amino acid. In the human body there are only 21 amino acids - 9 of them are named _essential_ since they cannot be synthesized by our cells and have to be obtained from food. The table below lists the 21 amino acids (essential ones in bold) with their 3- and 1-letter abbreviations which are used in most diagrams.

| Amino acid   | Abbreviation |
|--------------|--------------|
|Alanine       | Ala (A)      |
|Arginine      | Arg (R)      |
|Asparagine    | Asn (N)      |
|Aspartic acid | Asp (D)      |
|Cysteine      | Cys (C)      |
|Glutamic acid | Glu (E)      |
|Glutamine     | Gln (Q)      |
|Glycine       | Gly (G)      |
|**Histidine** | His (H)      |
|**Isoleucine**| Ile (I)      |
|**Leucine**   | Leu (L)      |
|**Lysine**    | Lys (K)      |
|**Methionine**| Met (M)      |
|**Phenylalanine**| Phe (F)   |
|Proline       | Pro (P)      |
|Selenocysteine| Sec (U)      |
|Serine        | Ser (S)      |
|**Threonine** | Thr (T)      |
|**Tryptophan**| Trp (W)      |
|Tyrosine      | Tyr (Y)      |
|**Valine**    | Val (V)      |

Any two amino acids can form a peptide bond between the amino and carboxyl group which produces a molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and two joined amino acids called a dipeptide. Three joined amino acids are a tripeptide, four - tetrapeptide, and so on. Generally, a _peptide_ is just a short chain of amino acids, usually less than 50.

However, proteins are really 3-dimensional objects, each one with a unique shape. When the amino acid chain is formed, it twists and folds in a certain way depending on interactions between the amino acid side chains (hydrogen bonds). This is called the _secondary structure_ of protein, consisting primarily of alpha helixes and beta sheets. Those then fold again based on chemical interactions to form the _tertiary structure_ which is a the compact shape of the protein molecule. Some proteins also form a _quaternary structure_ which is a collection of subunits. The image on the right (by <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Evolution_and_evolvability" title="User:Evolution and evolvability">Thomas Shafee</a> - <span class="int-own-work" lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution 4.0">CC BY 4.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=52821068">Link</a>) does a great job to illustrate the different types of structures.

This complex 3D shape is what gives proteins their unique properties and makes them very selective in how they react with other proteins. That is how in some cells they act as _receptors_ needing just the right substance to bind with. Because of their small size proteins cannot be seen with a microscope so their structure is usually mapped using X-ray crystallography.

Let's check out this model (by <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Gabby8228" title="User:Gabby8228">Gabby8228</a> - <span class="int-own-work" lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17990935">Link</a>) of hemoglobin A (α2β2), the normal human adult hemoglobin. It's hard to tell from the picture but it's a tetramer, i.e. it has four subunits (quaternary structure) - 2 of them are called alpha and the other 2 - beta. You can clearly see that it almost entirely consists of helixes (secondary structure) connected by short segments. The α chains each have 141 amino acids (called residues when they are part of a chain), and the β chains have 146 residues each, for a total of 574 residues and 4558 atoms. Each chain has a heme iron complex which can bind one oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>), so the hemoglobin protein can bind four oxygen molecules. The heme group is indeed non-protein but it's an integral part of the hemoglobin molecule and what actually enables it to do its job.

## Protein synthesis

Proteins are made by cells - any cell from a single-cell bacteria to a plant leaf cell to a human liver cell produces a variety of different proteins. Specialization of cells in an organism occurs largely because of the different proteins they make. Here we'll look specifically at human cells although the process is very similar in all cells.

Each gene in a chromosome (inside the cell nucleus) contains the information required to synthesize one specific protein. When a cell needs to make a protein, it copies the appropriate gene and based on its instructions builds a polypeptide by chaining together different amino acids. Now for the details.

### Gene transcription and translation

  ![DNA structure and bases][dna_structure_bases]{: align="right" style="padding: 10px;"}

  A gene is a sequence of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and is part of a chromosome. The DNA molecule is a very long coiled double helix which is spooled and compacted but still it is so long that is broken up into 46 chromosomes (or 23 pairs, the last pair containing either `XX` or `XY` chromosomes). The DNA in all the chromosomes is the entire genetic material (estimated at some 20,000 genes) and is stored inside the nucleus of each cell (except for sperm/egg cells and red blood cells). The two DNA strands are made of sugar phosphate and are held together by base pairs. The pairs are always formed between adenine (`A`) - thymine (`T`), and cytosine (`C`) - guanine (`G`). This means that the whole helix can be reconstructed from either half (which is what happens during DNA replication). So a gene is just a long sequence of bases with a defined beginning and an end. Three consecutive bases are called a _codon_ and encode for a specific amino acid (e.g. ATG translates to methionine, and TGG to tryptophan). Since there are 4<sup>3</sup>=64 permutations possible, a bunch of different codons translate to the same amino acid (e.g. UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG all translate to leucine). In addition, there are start and stop codons that determine where the translation should start and end.

  A gene is copied via a process called _transcription_. The DNA double helix temporarily splits open at the section where the gene is located and one side is transcribed to a strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) which then leaves the nucleus and finds a ribosome which can translate it into an actual amino acid chain. Ribosomes are amazing protein-building machines that are usually found at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but can also be floating freely in the cytoplasm. They attach to the beginning of the mRNA chain and start moving up and matching each codon to a corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule which carries a specific amino acid. The amino acids are chained together until the end of the mRNA is reached. The protein is then released and proceeds to fold and assume its 3D structure. The translation happens really fast - a ribosome can assemble a small protein in just a few seconds.

  ![Ribosome protein translation][ribosome_translation]{: align="right" style="padding: 10px;"}

  The following animation (By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bensaccount" class="extiw" title="en:User:Bensaccount">Bensaccount</a> at <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">en.wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8287100">Link</a>) demonstrates how the _translation_ works. The ribosome has two parts - the smaller one (in yellow) binds to the mRNA, and the larger one (in green) binds to the tRNA and amino acids. The tRNA molecules are dark blue and the resulting polypeptide chain is in black. You can see that the ribosome attaches to the endoplasmic reticulum wall and the produced protein goes into the ER where it will get folded properly and will probably get transported in a vesicle to the Golgi apparatus, the dispatch station for proteins. The protein can then be secreted outside the cell, embedded into the cell membrane, or sent to some other part of the cell.

> Wait! If each cell has the complete DNA, does that mean that each cell in the body can produce any of the encoded proteins?
>> Each cell in the human body does have the complete DNA (with minor exceptions) because they all descended from the same fertilized egg, however, as the embryo develops each cell becomes specialized to only produce certain proteins. This is called _gene expression_ and is controlled by complex mechanisms that can block the transcription of certain genes or their translation to proteins. Some genes are expressed (or turned on) in almost all cells - for example those that have to do with basic cell functions - and others are specific to the type of cell - for example, only the beta cells in the pancreas express the INS gene controlling insulin production. Gene expression also varies based on different stimuli, i.e. deciding when exactly to start or stop making a certain protein.

## Types of proteins

Let's look at some examples of different types of proteins and their function.

### Messenger proteins

These are small proteins usually called _hormones_ and they coordinate processes between cells. They are secreted by specialized cells in response to a specific stimulus, circulate in the blood and attach to matching cell membrane receptors triggering a reaction. Keep in mind that there are other types of hormones but we're only considering peptide-based ones here, such as _insulin_ and _thyroid-stimulating hormone_ (TSH).

Insulin is one of the most studied proteins due it its connection to diabetes. It is stored and secreted by beta cells in the pancreatic islets in response to blood glucose increase. Initially, a preproinsulin polypeptide is translated from the INS gene and is then converted to proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum and finally matures to insulin. After getting released into the bloodstream it attaches to cells that have an insulin receptor, mostly in muscle and fat tissue, causing them to start taking up glucose. This effectively reduces the glucose levels in the blood and the insulin molecules are recycled by the liver and kidneys. Type 1 diabetes results when the immune system starts (incorrectly) targeting the beta cells and eventually destroys them, so no insulin can be produced. Type 2 diabetes develops as a result of insulin resistance by the muscle/fat cells which prevents them from absorbing glucose - the exact reasons are still unknown.

TSH is a glycoprotein produced by the anterior pituitary when the concentration of thyroid hormones (T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>) decreases. It binds to the TSH receptor on the surface of thyroid follicular cells and stimulates the production of T<sub>4</sub> and then T<sub>3</sub> hormones. In turn, T<sub>3</sub> has wide-ranging effects throughout the entire body, such as increasing the basal metabolic rate and the rate of protein synthesis.

> What other hormones are there?
>> Besides protein/peptide hormones, there are also _amine_ and _steroid_ hormones. Amines are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan and include epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. They are short-lived (couple of minutes) and also act as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.
Steroids are derived from cholesterol (lipid), therefore they are hydrophobic and must bind to a transport protein to circulate in the blood. Some examples are cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. A unique property of the steroid hormones is that they diffuse through the cell membrane (since it is also lipid-based) and bind to a receptor inside the cytoplasm or nucleus which usually results in some kind of gene transcription. They also last much longer (several hours) and, unlike peptide and amine hormones, are not stored but are synthesized and released as needed.

### Receptors

Receptor proteins bind to hormones or other signaling molecules (also referred to as ligands) and trigger some response in a cell. They can be embedded in the cell membrane or can be inside the cell.
_Intracellular receptors_ bind to hydrophobic molecules that can pass through the membrane, e.g. steroid hormones, and then promote the transcription of a specific gene in the cell nucleus.
_Transmembrane receptors_ act in one of three ways: by activating an enzyme, opening an ion channel or activating a G-protein. The last mechanism is the most common one and is triggered when a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) binds a ligand and activates a G-protein inside the cell. The activated G-protein affects the production of a variety of second messenger molecules (such as cAMP), which in turn trigger a cascade of other reactions - some result in gene transcription, but others can cause the cell to secrete certain molecules. Let's continue our insulin example from before. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor of a cell it triggers a cascade reaction inside the cell that causes a glucose transporter protein (GLUT-4) to move to the cell membrane and facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. The glucose can be converted to ATP and used for energy or get converted to triglycerides in the fat cells (i.e. become body fat). The GLUT-4 protein is found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in fat cells, and its production can be stimulated by exercise (muscle stretching and contraction).

Each cell has many different receptors and is constantly receiving and responding to multiple signals. Those can trigger messengers and enzymes which could have an amplifying or conflicting effect with other reactions. It's a complex and delicate balance and it's easy to see why the exact causes of problems like insulin resistance are still unknown.

### Enzymes

Enzymes facilitate chemical reactions by binding to specific molecules and lowering the activation energy necessary to transform them into a product. Most of them end in _-ase_ and are highly specific to the molecules (called substrates) they bind to. This is a result of their specific tertiary structure and the amino acid R-groups at their active sites. Usually only one (or very few) types of molecules can fit and form bonds (hydrogen or ionic) to the R-groups at the active site that are strong enough so that a reaction can occur. Enzymes can be sensitive to temperature and acidity (pH).

Proteases are a group of enzymes that break down other proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. For example, in the human digestive system we have _pepsin_ produced in the stomach and _trypsin_ activated in the small intestine. They break down ingested proteins into amino acids which can then be absorbed into the blood. Pepsin is most active at pH 2.0 and does not work in an alkaline, or even neutral, environment.
Alcohol dehydrogenase is an enzyme that breaks down the toxic alcohol in the liver and stomach.
Lysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme present in tears, saliva and mucus. It breaks down the bonds in peptidoglycan, a polymer forming the cell walls of most bacteria.

Sometimes there are similar molecules that can bind to an enzyme and just sit there without producing a reaction - those are called competitive enzyme inhibitors - and prevent the enzyme from binding to the intended substrate. Others, called non-competitive inhibitors, bind to a different part of the enzyme and change its structure so it can no longer bind properly to the substrate. A lot of therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. For example, penicillin binds to the bacterial enzyme _DD-transpeptidase_, preventing the cell from producing peptidoglycan crosslinks in its wall and eventually bursting. Cyanide acts as a competitive inhibitor to the enzyme _cytochrome c oxidase (COX)_ by binding with high affinity and preventing the transfer of electrons which prevents the synthesis of ATP and causes the cell to quickly run out of energy. Protease inhibitors are a key part of antiretroviral therapy. For example, they are used effectively to stop the HIV virus which relies on a protease enzyme to cleave a polypeptide and produce active proteins (this is typical for a lot of viruses).
Inhibitors can also be employed by the body to disable certain enzymes as a result of a feedback loop.

### Storage proteins

Storage proteins store amino acids and metal ions for later use. In animals, these include ovalbumin in egg white and casein in milk. In plants, they are found in the seeds where they are used during germination and are in especially high concentrations in legumes. However, the most studied example is _ferritin_ which is found in almost all living organisms. Essentially a buffer against iron deficiency (or overload), ferritin stores iron and releases it in a controlled manner. This also limits the accumulation of toxic free iron which aids the formation of free radicals. The ferritin molecule consists of 24 identical subunits forming a hollow sphere. Iron is stored in the core and can pass through channels in the shell formed between the different subunits.

> What are free radicals?
>> A free radical is an atom/molecule that contains an unpaired electron (note that this doesn't imply charge as in ions) and as a result is unstable and highly reactive as they are trying to either lose or obtain an electron. In the human body two of the most dangerous ones are the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>−). They can cause protein degradation, lipid per-oxidation in the cell membranes, and can damage DNA causing mutations and cancer. Free radicals are a normal byproduct of many reactions in the cells but they are usually kept in check by antioxidants which can donate an electron and neutralize them. A lot of antioxidants are produced by the body but others need to be obtained from diet, e.g. vitamins A, C and E. Still, free radicals may have a significant influence on aging.

### Transport proteins

There are two main groups of transport proteins - one that carries molecules throughout the body (mostly in the blood), and the other that transports ions and molecules across cell membranes.

Lipid-based steroid hormones and thyroid hormones do not dissolve in water and thus cannot be effectively carried in the blood plasma. Highly-selective transport proteins bind to them and shuttle them throughout the body. For example, _thyroxine-binding globulin_ (TBG) binds to the thyroid hormones (T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>) and _sex hormone binding globulin_ (SHBG) binds to testosterone and estradiol. Only hormones that are free (i.e. not bound to a protein) can diffuse through the cell membrane and do their job. That's why some blood tests measure the levels of free hormones (e.g. free T<sub>4</sub> or free testosterone) as those are the actual bioactive ones. They usually represent a very small percentage of the total hormones, the majority being bound to transport proteins. This points out another very important function of those proteins as reservoirs and buffers for hormones, helping maintain the correct balance. In addition, there are non-selective transport proteins such as human serum albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood plasma. It can bind (although with lower affinity) and carry pretty much any fat soluble molecules in the blood, including steroid and thyroid hormones, fatty acids, flavonoids, as well as drugs and cations. Albumin and the globulin transport proteins are synthesized and degraded in the liver. _Endocrine disruptors_, if in high enough concentrations, may bind to some of the transport proteins and interfere with proper delivery of the sex and especially thyroid hormones.

_Hemoglobin_ is another important transport protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells to all parts of the body. It can bind 70 times more oxygen than can be dissolved in the blood. Unfortunately, hemoglobin also binds cyanide (CN) and carbon monoxide (CO), effectively inhibiting oxygen-binding. Actually, it has 250 times greater affinity for CO than for O<sub>2</sub> which explains the dangerous toxicity of carbon monoxide.

In addition, there are three classes of _membrane transport proteins_ which carry molecules across cell membranes. _ATP pumps_ use energy from ATP hydrolysis to move ions and molecules against a concentration gradient - for example, pumping out calcium and sodium ions in almost all cells to maintain low concentrations inside. _Channel proteins_ open a channel allowing the quick passage of multiple ions/molecules, such as potassium ions which normalize the electric potential across the cell membrane. _Transporters_, on the other hand, bind only a single molecule at a time and carry it across the membrane - thus they are much slower than channels. The glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins are an example of a transporter that carries glucose, a very polar molecule (generally, small electrically neutral molecules can pass more easily). Some of them allow glucose to pass in either direction, e.g. in liver cells glucose is transported outside the cell.

### Contractile proteins

Contractile proteins are associated mostly with muscle. Different muscles are composed of different arrangements of filaments - thick and thin - forming myofibrils. Each thick filament has about 300 molecules of the protein _myosin_. Thin filaments are composed of about 300 molecules of the protein _actin_ (as well as regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin). Thick and thin filaments are intermixed and when activated, myosin attaches to actin, causing contraction.

In addition, contractile proteins play a significant role inside the cells and actually actin is the most abundant protein, accounting for about 10% of all proteins in the cell. It forms microfilaments which are a main component of the cytoskeleton and thus determine the shape of cells. They also drive cell motility allowing the cell to probe its environment. During cell division, actin and myosin form a constricting ring which divides the cell into two daughter cells.

### Antibodies

Antibodies are glycoproteins as they have an added sugar chain, and are also called _immunoglobulins_ (Ig). A key part of the immune system, they are produced by B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and attach to a specific antigen triggering some reaction, for example, tagging a virus or bacteria and attracting phagocytes to destroy it.
The unique property of antibodies is their diversity. They are composed of two identical heavy and two identical light chains which together form something resembling the letter `Y`. The tops of the `Y` arms have a variable region that can only bind to a specific marker molecule (usually on the surface of a pathogen). Since there could be billions of different markers (each bacteria/virus has a different marker) there couldn't possibly be enough genes (we only have about 20,000) to code for all the different antibody proteins. So during the maturation of B lymphocytes the variable region of their antibodies is randomly synthesized by recombining and mutating sections of the gene. At any time the human body maintains about a billion unique B lymphocytes, any of which, if triggered by a matching antigen, can start secreting a thousand antibodies per second to mount an immune response. However, this system is not perfect and antibodies can also be responsible for many of the allergies and autoimmune diseases.

### Structural proteins

These are different from all the others as they are _fibrous_ proteins, forming long fibers that provide structural support. In contrast, the types of proteins listed above are called _globular_ as they have a spherical shape and readily dissolve in water. _Fibrous_ and _globular_ refer to the tertiary structure.

Structural proteins usually contain several α-helixes wound together to form elongated fibrils. Popular examples are collagen and keratin.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body (about 30% of all proteins) and is found in the skin, blood vessels, muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, cartilage and some organs. It has great tensile strength and gives tissues flexibility. It requires vitamin C to be synthesized properly by the cells - that's why in the disease scurvy the major symptoms are due to lack of collagen. When _denatured_, for example, by heating, it turns into gelatin.
Keratin in mammals is the α-keratin form as its secondary structure is α-helixes. It's found in the hair, nails (hard keratin) and skin epidermis (soft keratin). Reptiles and birds have β-keratin (containing β-sheets) which is much stronger and builds the reptile skin and bird beaks, claws and feathers.

> What's protein denaturation?
>> It's a process that destroys the primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure of a protein causing it to lose its shape and thus its ability to function. Especially hydrogen bonds, which play a big part in secondary and tertiary structure formation, are rather weak and usually the first ones to be disrupted. This can be caused by heat, radiation, mechanical agitation, acids/bases, alcohol, formaldehyde, etc. For example, high fever (above 41°C/105.8°F) will cause some proteins in the body to start breaking down. Alcohol disinfectant applied to the skin penetrates bacteria's cell walls and denatures the proteins inside them. Also when you eat proteins they get denatured in your stomach by the hydrochloric acid.

## Protein in diet

Protein that we consume as food needs to get broken down to amino acids in order to be useful. Ultimately, amino acids are the building blocks that are used by cells to synthesize other proteins as needed. Polypeptides are broken down by a process called hydrolysis - inserting a water molecule between two amino  acids in order to break the bond between them.

> How do proteins get digested?
>> The first step of the process happens in the stomach when hydrochloric (HCl) acid denatures the ingested proteins. This makes them more accessible to the _pepsin_ enzyme which breaks the peptide bonds between specific amino acids. Pepsin is most active at a highly acidic pH of 2 so the stomach is the perfect place for this. The partially digested polypeptides then proceed to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, where they are further degraded by _trypsin_ and _chymotrypsin_ to di-/tri- peptides and free amino acids. The trypsin and chymotrypsin precursors are actually synthesized in the pancreas but are activated in the duodenum. They work best in an alkaline environment with pH around 8. The resulting small peptides and amino acids are small enough that they can be absorbed by the villi in the small intestine and move into the bloodstream. There they circulate and can be used by any cells that need them.

As we mentioned before, there are 9 _essential amino acids_: phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine. Since they cannot be produced by the human body they must be obtained from diet. Foods that contain all essential amino acids are called _complete protein_ or _high-quality protein_. Those include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, as well as quinoa, buckwheat and soy. Of course, you can also combine foods that complement each other, such as rice and beans, or bread and hummus, to get complete protein.

In contrast to fats and carbohydrates, protein is not stored in the body so it needs to be supplied on a daily basis. The recommended daily intake is about 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight for the average adult. This is assuming the protein contains all essential amino acids. So what happens if there's not enough protein to meet the demands of the body? It will try to get the required amino acids from the largest reserves in the body, such as myosin/actin (skeletal muscle) and collagen (tendon, ligament, cartilage). Over time this will result in loss of body mass and may also affect the joints and the immune system.

Extra protein from the diet can be converted to urea or glucose in the liver. Urea is excreted in urine by the kidneys. Glucose can be used to maintain healthy blood sugar levels or can be turned into fat and stored.
