The immune system is one of the most complicated as it involves a lot of different cells which communicate among each other and can often affect the working of other systems in the body. Besides fighting infections, recently there's been strong evidence that the immune system can be targeted to help overcome autoimmune diseases and cancer. By understanding how it works we may be able to explain many chronic conditions and the effects of stress and inflammation.  

The immune system is often categorized into innate and adaptive portions. Innate immunity is non-specific and targets all foreign substances, viruses, bacteria, toxins, etc. It is common to all living things and represents the majority of the immune system. The adaptive part adds the ability to target specific antigens much more precisely and to memorize them for future encounters. This is present in almost all vertebrates and mostly has to do with lymphocytes and antibodies. In addition, you may hear of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which is another categorization. For the purposes of understanding human immunity I think all those divisions are confusing so we're not going to mention them again.

## Cells of the immune system

The main cells of the immune system are the white blood cells, also called leukocytes. Here's a table summary of all the main types:

## Organs and tissues of the immune system

The immune system relies heavily on the _lymphatic system_ and its organs such as the _spleen_ and _thymus_, and the _lymph nodes_. _Bone marrow_ produces most cells of the immune system. The _skin_ acts as a barrier isolating the body from the external pathogens. In addition, _mucous membranes_ of all body openings to the outside act as specialized checkpoints. Other parts of the body associated with the immune system include the _tonsils_, _adenoids_, parts of the small intestine and _appendix_.

  - Bone marrow

    Bone marrow is spongy tissue inside the bones, such as pelvis, sternum and ribs. In newborns active (red) bone marrow is found in many other bones, e.g. femur and humerus, but with age it converts to fatty tissue as it's no longer needed in such quantities. It contains hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to all the blood cells, including red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets (thrombocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes), and can produce some 500 billion cells per day. For the purposes of the immune system, we are primarily concerned with white blood cells, which differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid lineages.

  - Thymus

    The thymus gland is located behind the sternum and reaches its peak at puberty, gradually shrinking and becoming replaced by fat afterwards. Its main function is to train the T cells (lymphocytes) to distinguish between self and non-self in an antigen-controlled environment. This ensures that they will only target foreign or diseased cells.

  - Lymph nodes

    The lymph nodes are bean-sized organs spread all over the body with the largest clusters being in the neck, the groin, the abdomen, and under the arms (some are under the skin and others are deep inside the body). They filter lymph fluid and contain many B and T cells which spend a lot of time there waiting to become activated by a matching antigen. Lymph nodes may become swollen due to infections in a nearby area and various other diseases.

  - Spleen

    The spleen is an organ to the left of the stomach and behind the ribs and is similar to a large lymph node. It recycles old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood but also plays a role in the immune system. It has a lot of nodules containing B and T cells. In addition, it holds about half of all monocytes so they can be quickly released when needed.

## Lymphatic system

The lymphatic system plays two major roles:

  - Drains extra fluid (lymph) from the tissues
  - Filters that fluid through the lymph nodes where it can be checked by immune cells

First, to understand why there is extra fluid, let's consider the circulatory system. The veins actually return less blood than leaks from the arteries into the tissues. Over the course of the day that leaked fluid adds up to about 3 liters. If it's not absorbed by the lymph capillaries it would lead to lymphedema. The lymph capillaries are also much more permeable so they can pick up much larger particles than the veins, for example, proteins and foreign particles that might have found their way into the tissues. They take the fluid to lymph nodes which act as checkpoints where pathogens can be destroyed by resident macrophages and antigens can trigger the stationed B and T cells. Eventually, larger lymph vessels return the lymph to the bloodstream by emptying into the subclavian veins. This system also ensures that white blood cells can circulate from the blood to the tissues and then the lymph nodes.

Structurally, lymph vessels are similar to veins - they have valves to prevent back flow and rely on external compression to move the lymph. That's why exercise and muscle contractions improve the functioning of the lymphatic (and circulatory) system. In addition, the flow rate is increased by deep breathing because it creates negative pressure in the thoracic cavity.

## Immune system signaling

White blood cells (and other cells) can release cytokines to trigger specific reactions in other cells. This is a broad category or proteins, which have matching cell surface receptors, and can cause the up- or down-regulation of genes and the expression of other proteins. They are similar to hormones but their numbers can increase drastically when an immune response is triggered.

Cytokines are divided into several different groups:

  - _chemokines_ - guide the migration of cells by attracting them - there are about 50 of these classified into 4 families: CC (β-chemokines),  CXC (α-chemokines), C (γ-chemokines) and CX<sub>3</sub>C
  - _interleukins_ (some of these are called lymphokines) - there are more than 30 of these identified now, but probably more will be added, labeled IL-1, IL-2, etc.
  - _interferons_ - interfere with viral replication (but also have other functions) - 3 types: Type I IFN (e.g. IFN-α, IFN-β), Type II IFN (IFNγ) and Type III IFN
  - _tumor necrosis factors_ - cause cell death (e.g. TNF-α)
  - _colony-stimulating factors_ - involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into specific types of cells (e.g. CSF1)

  > On naming in immunology
  >> From my experience, all the names and different groups (not just above but in general when studying the immune system) are really confusing and in most cases not worth trying to make sense of. A lot of them were named for some reason historically but then new discoveries were made and the original name stuck. Other things may have multiple names or belong to several groups.

## Complement system

The complement system consists of some 30 proteins that play a critical role in neutralizing foreign cells once they are detected. The complement proteins (named C1, C2, etc) are produced by the liver cells and by macrophages, and circulate in the blood until they are activated. This can happen in 3 ways which all trigger different cascading reactions:

  - when foreign material or damaged cells are detected - called the _alternative pathway_
  - when antigen-antibody complexes are formed - called the _classical pathway_
  - when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to carbohydrates found on many pathogens - called the _lectin pathway_

The three pathways ultimately converge and cause rupturing of the cell walls of bacteria or the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils.
