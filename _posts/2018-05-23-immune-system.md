The immune system is one of the most complicated as it involves a lot of different cells which communicate among each other and can often affect the working of other systems in the body. Besides fighting infections, recently there's been strong evidence that the immune system can be targeted to help overcome autoimmune diseases and cancer. By understanding how it works we may be able to explain many chronic conditions and the effects of stress and inflammation.  

The immune system is often categorized into innate and adaptive portions. Innate immunity is non-specific and targets all foreign substances, viruses, bacteria, toxins, etc. It is common to all living things and represents the majority of the immune system. The adaptive part adds the ability to target specific antigens much more precisely and to memorize them for future encounters. This is present in almost all vertebrates and mostly has to do with lymphocytes and antibodies.

## Cells of the immune system

The main cells of the immune system are the white blood cells, also called leukocytes. Here's a table summary of all the main types:

## Organs and tissues of the immune system

The immune system relies heavily on the _lymphatic system_ and its organs such as the _spleen_ and _thymus_, and the _lymph nodes_. _Bone marrow_ produces most cells of the immune system. The _skin_ acts as a barrier isolating the body from the external pathogens. In addition, _mucous membranes_ of all body openings to the outside act as specialized checkpoints. Other parts of the body associated with the immune system include the _tonsils_, _adenoids_, parts of the small intestine and _appendix_.

  - Bone marrow

    Bone marrow is spongy tissue inside the bones, such as pelvis, sternum and ribs. In newborns active (red) bone marrow is found in many other bones, e.g. femur and humerus, but with age it converts to fatty tissue as it's no longer needed in such quantities. It contains hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to all the blood cells, including red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets (thrombocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes), and can produce some 500 billion cells per day. For the purposes of the immune system, we are primarily concerned with white blood cells, which differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid lineages.

  - Thymus

    The thymus gland is located behind the sternum and reaches its peak at puberty, gradually shrinking and becoming replaced by fat afterwards. Its main function is to train the T cells (lymphocytes) to distinguish between self and non-self in an antigen-controlled environment. This ensures that they will only target foreign or diseased cells.

  - Lymph nodes

    The lymph nodes are bean-sized organs spread all over the body with the largest clusters being in the neck, the groin, the abdomen, and under the arms (some are under the skin and others are deep inside the body). They filter lymph fluid and contain many B and T cells which spend a lot of time there waiting to become activated by a matching antigen. Lymph nodes may become swollen due to infections in a nearby area and various other diseases.

  - Spleen

    The spleen is an organ to the left of the stomach and behind the ribs and is similar to a large lymph node. It recycles old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood but also plays a role in the immune system. It has a lot of nodules containing B and T cells. In addition, it holds about half of all monocytes so they can be quickly released when needed.

  - Lymphoid aggregates

    These are spread out across the body in locations that get exposed to a lot of foreign substances. Like the lymph nodes, the goal is to get antigens in contacts with lymphocytes. The main types are:
    * Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
    * Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
    * Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)

## Lymphatic system

The lymphatic system plays two major roles:

  - Drains extra fluid (lymph) from the tissues
  - Filters that fluid through the lymph nodes where it can be checked by immune cells

First, to understand why there is extra fluid, let's consider the circulatory system. The veins actually return less blood than leaks from the arteries into the tissues. Over the course of the day that leaked fluid adds up to about 3 liters. If it's not absorbed by the lymph capillaries it would lead to lymphedema. The lymph capillaries are also much more permeable so they can pick up much larger particles than the veins, for example, proteins and foreign particles that might have found their way into the tissues. They take the fluid to lymph nodes which act as checkpoints where pathogens can be destroyed by resident macrophages and antigens can trigger the stationed B and T cells. Eventually, larger lymph vessels return the lymph to the bloodstream by emptying into the subclavian veins. This system also ensures that white blood cells can circulate from the blood to the tissues and then the lymph nodes.

Structurally, lymph vessels are similar to veins - they have valves to prevent back flow and rely on external compression to move the lymph. That's why exercise and muscle contractions improve the functioning of the lymphatic (and circulatory) system. In addition, the flow rate is increased by deep breathing because it creates negative pressure in the thoracic cavity.

## Immune system signaling

White blood cells (and other cells) can release cytokines to trigger specific reactions in other cells. This is a broad category or proteins, which have matching cell surface receptors, and can cause the up- or down-regulation of genes and the expression of other proteins. They are similar to hormones but their numbers can increase drastically when an immune response is triggered.

Cytokines are divided into several different groups:

  - _chemokines_ - guide the migration of cells by attracting them - there are about 50 of these classified into 4 families: CC (β-chemokines),  CXC (α-chemokines), C (γ-chemokines) and CX<sub>3</sub>C
  - _interleukins_ (some of these are called lymphokines) - there are more than 30 of these identified now, but probably more will be added, labeled IL-1, IL-2, etc.
  - _interferons_ - interfere with viral replication (but also have other functions) - 3 types: Type I IFN (e.g. IFN-α, IFN-β), Type II IFN (IFNγ) and Type III IFN
  - _tumor necrosis factors_ - cause cell death (e.g. TNF-α)
  - _colony-stimulating factors_ - involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into specific types of cells (e.g. CSF1)

  > On naming in immunology
  >> From my experience, all the names and different groups (not just above but in general when studying the immune system) are really confusing and in most cases not worth trying to make sense of. A lot of them were named for some reason historically but then new discoveries were made and the original name stuck. Other things may have multiple names or belong to several groups.

## Complement system

The complement system consists of some 30 proteins that play a critical role in neutralizing foreign cells once they are detected. The complement proteins (named C1, C2, etc) are produced by the liver cells and by macrophages, and circulate in the blood until they are activated. This can happen in 3 ways which all trigger different cascading reactions:

  - when foreign material or damaged cells are detected - called the _alternative pathway_
  - when antigen-antibody complexes are formed - called the _classical pathway_
  - when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to carbohydrates found on many pathogens - called the _lectin pathway_

The three pathways ultimately converge and cause rupturing of the cell walls of bacteria or the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils.

## How it all works

When a microorganism penetrates the body's physical barriers it gets in contact with some of the immune system cells patrolling the tissues. Most times this is accompanied by the process of inflammation which increases blood flow to the affected area and releases cytokines that attract more white blood cells. The "first responders" are neutrophils and macrophages.

_Neutrophils_ are short-lived cells that circulate in the blood in large numbers and can engulf pathogens and destroy them (called "phagocytosis"). They are fast to respond and start to accumulate within minutes.
_Macrophages_ ("large eaters") are larger cells that can also phagocytize invading pathogens, and release cytokines to attract other immune cells. They can also process antigens and present them to T-cells for activation of an adaptive immune response.
Other cells of the innate immune system that are recruited include _basophils_, _eosinophils_ and _mast cells_.

> How do macrophages and granulocytes recognize pathogens?
>> They have different pattern recognition receptors that bind to molecules typically found on microbes and other foreign substances. One type is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) which is mostly responsible for detecting extracellular pathogens (e.g. bacteria). Another one is the NOD-like receptor (NLR) which recognizes intracellular pathogens in the cytosol.

In the case of a viral infection some of the body's own cells have been hijacked by the virus which is using them to replicate itself. In those cases the immune system natural killer (NK) cells can recognize which cells are in distress and execute them by releasing different molecules at close proximity. Perforins cause the formation of pores into the target cells and granzymes enter the cells via those pores and can trigger lysis (rupture of the cell wall) or apoptosis (programmed cell death).

> How do NK cells know which cells to attack?
>> They have special receptors called killer-cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) which bind to MHC molecules which normally exist on the surface of all cells. Diseased cells (virus-infected or tumor cells) have fewer MHC molecules and cannot bind properly to the KIRs to inhibit the activation of the NK cells.

> What's MHC?
>> MHC stands for _major histocompatibility complex_ and is a family of surface proteins which are present on all cells of the body and are responsible for tissue compatibility. Cells break down peptides present in their cytosol and present pieces of them on their surface attached to their MHC receptors. It's like a window into the cell and a way for the immune system (T cells) to quickly examine different cells. If the presented peptide is foreign it will trigger a cytotoxic response from T cells. If MHC molecules are missing (or reduced) it will trigger a response from NK cells. In humans MHC is also referred to as HLA (human leukocyte antigen).

> What's the difference between lysis and apoptosis?
>> _Lysis_ simply causes the cell to rupture and spill out its entire contents causing an inflammatory reaction in the area and requires cleanup by macrophages. It is rarely the desired outcome, especially in the case of a virally infected cell which is going to release all viral particles when it ruptures. _Apoptosis_, on the other hand, triggers internal mechanisms to cleanly shut down the cell, recycling all internal parts and destroying any virions.

The next step of the immune response involves B and T cells which target very specific parts of the invading pathogen, called antigen. This is the acquired part of immunity which involves the production of antibodies and needs input from the innate system. When macrophages and dendritic cells digest pathogens they display parts of them (as peptides) on their surface and travel to the lymph nodes where they can get in close contact with lymphocytes. Any naive T cells that have matching receptors (TCRs) for the presented peptide become activated and start multiplying. At the same time, naive B cells that get in touch with a matching antigen become activated _if_ they also get a co-stimulatory signal from a helper T cell. Those B cells start multiplying and produce plasma cells which start secreting millions of antibodies. This process takes about 4-5 days, compared to minutes for the innate non-specific response. The antibodies (which are just proteins that stick to their matching antigen) circulate in the blood (especially to sites of inflammation) and tag the pathogen by forming antigen-antibody complexes. They don't actually do anything to kill it but they can slow it down by clumping multiple pathogens together. The release of cytokines activates the classical pathway of the complement system which ruptures the cell walls of the microorganisms and attracts more macrophages. In addition, the activated T cells seek out and destroy more of the offenders by lysis. This is similar to how the NK cells operate but is much more specific - e.g. the T cells could attack a specific kind of bacteria but skip another one, even if it's very similar, because it doesn't match its TCR.

The immune response eventually winds down and the B and T lymphocytes die but a few memory cells are left behind and can live for a long time (years). Next time the same pathogen is encountered, the secondary response is much faster and stronger.
